# what

this was a shower-thought "oh yeah what-if" website. 

not necessarily a project, more of a demonstration and experimentation of deploying Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers.

and maybe getting feet wetter with React.

certainly not CSS though, the CSS is still bad and i'm too dumb to comprehend fixing it, leave alone fix it.
